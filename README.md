Vincent Lin and Ahnaf Kazi's Final Project

How to Compile and Run:

	Run FinalProject.java from master branch to start the game. We added some cheats, heres how to access them: when you run FinalProject type an integer after, that integer is how many lives you start with, the third integer will be your starting points. Points determine your level, and therefore the difficulty can be changed based on that number.

How to Play:

	Use the arrow keys to move the player, a spaceship. Navigate around projectiles, which will be moving down the screen at random.Your score will increase and with it your level, as your level increases, so does the difficulty of the game. You start off with three lives and if you touch a projectile, you will lose a life, be moved back to the starting place, and be invincible for a span of about 2 seconds. Once you lose all your lives, the game ends and you are given your score and highscore as well as the option to restart the game. if you exit the game your highscore for the session will be lost.
